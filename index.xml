Setupconfig.ini Setupconfig.ini is a file that can be used to pass command line arguments to the Windows Setup engine during a Windows installation. When Setupconfig.ini is specified in the command line (/ConfigFile &amp;lt;path to Setupconfig.ini&amp;gt;) or exists in the default location (%systemdrive%\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WSUS\Setupconfig.ini), any arguments in it will take precedence over arguments specified in the commandline.

Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ve come across SetupDiag.

During that process, I found that several of my clients had successfully been upgraded, but were still reporting the old OS version in the ConfigMgr console. My search led to several root causes which I&amp;rsquo;m still working through, but the solution in most cases was to force a Full Hardware Inventory on the client or fully uninstall, clean and reinstall the client - I also won&amp;rsquo;t go into those steps here.</description></item><item><title>Debugging “Failed to compile rule” client errors after SCCM Application Catalog Role Removal</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/07/10/debugging-failed-to-compile-rule-client-errors-after-sccm-application-catalog-role-removal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:06:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/07/10/debugging-failed-to-compile-rule-client-errors-after-sccm-application-catalog-role-removal/</guid><description>In my post Removing the Application Catalog Role after Upgrading to ConfigMgr 1806 I mentioned the error Failed to compile rule &amp;quot;{Rule_WRC10000}&amp;quot;: 0x8000ffff and that we were unsure of it&amp;rsquo;s impact on the client.

Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t have 802.1x setup in a lab to show how to configure the 802.1x service on the server side. However, I do know that you will need to configure your 802.1x service to allow PXE traffic. I believe that Cisco ISE has a setting already that you can just turn on to allow it.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 1 – Building an 802.1x Computer Authentication Script</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</guid><description>This is Part 1 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve continued to service the WIM and use it as our production image.
