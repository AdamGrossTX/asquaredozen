I&amp;rsquo;m paranoid. We recently upgraded our site to ConfigMgr 2002, first fast ring, then the hotfix. We also installed a Cloud Management Gateway, re-worked our Boundary Groups to handle VPN better, added a second Management Point and generally made a butt-load of changes to our environment to help our remote clients have access to content more easily.</description></item><item><title>Making Continue on PC Work with Microsoft Windows Consumer Features Disabled in Windows 10</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/12/03/making-continue-on-pc-work-with-microsoft-windows-consumer-features-disabled-in-windows-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 23:31:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/12/03/making-continue-on-pc-work-with-microsoft-windows-consumer-features-disabled-in-windows-10/</guid><description>I recently had a request to make the Continue on PC feature work on our standard Windows 10 devices.

Quick Note About Cisco Switch Firmware If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far, a word of caution. Make sure that your switch firmware is matched to the version required by ISE. I spent several weeks working with our Security and Networking guys to troubleshoot and discovered that our switches weren&amp;rsquo;t at the required version for ISE 2.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 3 – Integrating 802.1x Authentication into a Bare Metal Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-3-integrating-802-1x-authentication-into-a-bare-metal-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-3-integrating-802-1x-authentication-into-a-bare-metal-task-sequence/</guid><description>This is Part 3 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

During a Bare Metal/Wipe &amp;amp; Load OSD Task Sequence, the Task Sequence will start in WinPE and copy down the OS installation files. Once Windows as been installed, the Task Sequence will boot out of WinPE and into the new OS.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 2 – Building an 802.1x Enabled WinPE Boot Image</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-2-building-an-802-1x-enabled-winpe-boot-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:17:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-2-building-an-802-1x-enabled-winpe-boot-image/</guid><description>This is Part 2 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t have 802.1x setup in a lab to show how to configure the 802.1x service on the server side. However, I do know that you will need to configure your 802.1x service to allow PXE traffic. I believe that Cisco ISE has a setting already that you can just turn on to allow it.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 1 – Building an 802.1x Computer Authentication Script</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</guid><description>This is Part 1 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

At the time, we had some consultants in helping us migrate from Windows XP to Windows 7. At the time, the consultant who was building the image edited the Local Group Polices on the Windows 7 machine prior to capturing it. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve continued to service the WIM and use it as our production image. Some years later, we were trying to change our Windows Update settings and found these nice Local Group Policies just sitting there screwing everything up!</description></item></channel></rss>
