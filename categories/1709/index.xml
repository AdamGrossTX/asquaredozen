Ultimately, Microsoft needs a better process for updating media each month, but until they do, all we can do is what we do best, Socially Engineer solutions.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Dynamic Update AND Ignoring Dissmissable Compatibility Warnings during an Windows 10 In-Place Upgrade Task Sequence in ConfigMgr</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/18/enabling-dynamic-update-and-ignoring-dissmissable-compatibility-warnings-during-an-windows-10-in-place-upgrade-task-sequence-in-configmgr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 13:49:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/18/enabling-dynamic-update-and-ignoring-dissmissable-compatibility-warnings-during-an-windows-10-in-place-upgrade-task-sequence-in-configmgr/</guid><description>WARNING!! 8/21/2018 - The following steps will enable Dynamic Updates for Windows 10 In-Place Upgrade.

At the time, we had some consultants in helping us migrate from Windows XP to Windows 7. At the time, the consultant who was building the image edited the Local Group Polices on the Windows 7 machine prior to capturing it. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve continued to service the WIM and use it as our production image. Some years later, we were trying to change our Windows Update settings and found these nice Local Group Policies just sitting there screwing everything up!</description></item><item><title>Triggering ConfigMgr Client Actions from a Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/06/14/triggering-configmgr-client-actions-from-a-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 04:20:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/06/14/triggering-configmgr-client-actions-from-a-task-sequence/</guid><description>This week, we were working on testing Windows 7 to Windows 10 In-Place Upgrades and ran into an issue where our clients weren&amp;rsquo;t updating their Operating System version in the ConfigMgr console. After some helpful responses on Twitter, I was able to add a client action trigger step to the end of my Task Sequence. In my production environment, we have a child task sequence that we call that has several client action steps in it including Request Machine Assignments (Machine Policies) {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021}, Hardware Inventory {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001} and now a Discovery Inventory {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003}.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 1709 In-Place Upgrade Hangs on Making sure you're ready to install</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/05/21/windows-10-1709-in-place-upgrade-hangs-on-making-sure-youre-ready-to-install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 19:34:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/05/21/windows-10-1709-in-place-upgrade-hangs-on-making-sure-youre-ready-to-install/</guid><description>UPDATE #3 - 6/28/2018 Feel free to read below, however, if you want the quick solution, check out Marc&amp;rsquo;s updated blog post.

We recently upgraded SCCM to 1710 then applied ADK 1709. We have been imaging these servers using the ADK 1703 Boot Image without issue. After upgrading to ADK 1709 and creating new boot images, we are unable to boot to into WinPE on any of our Gen9 servers. After doing the standard diagnostics (testing old, testing new, updating drivers, updating firmware, etc) we found that these servers would still freeze after downloading the boot WIM and get stuck on this screen:</description></item><item><title>Modern Driver Management and How I Barely Got It Working â€“ Some Lessons Learned</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 03:57:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</guid><description>Several months ago, my boss came back from Microsoft Ignite where he &amp;lsquo;drank the Kool-Aid&amp;rsquo; big time. We had been telling him about all of the amazing things that were being released to help with the move to Modern Windows Management with Windows 10 for months but he got to hear it directly from some of the experts and got really excited. One of the things he suggested looking into came from a session with Mike Nystrom and Johan Arwidmark called Expert-level Windows 10 deployment (Skip to 50:12 for driver management).</description></item><item><title>Windows 7 to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) In-Place Upgrade Fails with error 0xC1900204 (Invalid Sku)</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:07:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</guid><description>We have built an SCCM In-Place upgrade task sequence to migrate our enterprise from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise.
