A few months ago, when I published the first 4 parts on this series, I was unaware that there was a web service available for managing Cisco ISE, which is the NAC that I have to work with in my environment. I was fortunate to meet with a peer who works nearby and he shared a script demonstrating how to interact with the Cisco ISE External RESTful Service (ERS) to dynamically whitelist devices when WinPE starts for Bare Metal OSD and inside an SCCM/ConfigMgr Task Sequence for In-Place upgrades.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 05:13:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment/</guid><description>Update 10/1/2018 - Check out my latest post Part 5 below.

Quick Note About Cisco Switch Firmware If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far, a word of caution. Make sure that your switch firmware is matched to the version required by ISE. I spent several weeks working with our Security and Networking guys to troubleshoot and discovered that our switches weren&amp;rsquo;t at the required version for ISE 2.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 3 – Integrating 802.1x Authentication into a Bare Metal Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-3-integrating-802-1x-authentication-into-a-bare-metal-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-3-integrating-802-1x-authentication-into-a-bare-metal-task-sequence/</guid><description>This is Part 3 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

You will need all of the files you created in Part 1 for this part.
During a Bare Metal/Wipe &amp;amp; Load OSD Task Sequence, the Task Sequence will start in WinPE and copy down the OS installation files. Once Windows as been installed, the Task Sequence will boot out of WinPE and into the new OS.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 2 – Building an 802.1x Enabled WinPE Boot Image</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-2-building-an-802-1x-enabled-winpe-boot-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:17:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-2-building-an-802-1x-enabled-winpe-boot-image/</guid><description>This is Part 2 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t have 802.1x setup in a lab to show how to configure the 802.1x service on the server side. However, I do know that you will need to configure your 802.1x service to allow PXE traffic. I believe that Cisco ISE has a setting already that you can just turn on to allow it.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 1 – Building an 802.1x Computer Authentication Script</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:07:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-1-building-an-802-1x-computer-authentication-script/</guid><description>This is Part 1 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.
