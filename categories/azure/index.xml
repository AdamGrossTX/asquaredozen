Intune doesn&amp;rsquo;t support non-persistent VDI Azure Active Directory only supports Hybrid Azure AD Join for non-persistent VDI ConfigMgr recommends limiting client functionality on non-persistent VDI but there is no mention about the impact of Co-Management on these devices.

This is Part 3 of a 3-part series. Part 1covers how to create a PowerShell script to lookup error messages. Part 2 covers creating an Azure Function.
My goal is to use ConfigMgr ErrorCodes in a report in Power BI for easier deployment monitoring. As I mentioned in Part 1, the error text isn&amp;rsquo;t available in the ConfigMgr DB, so I created a PowerShell script to look up the error code.</description></item><item><title>Convert ConfigMgr Error Codes to Plain Text Messages for Reporting – Part 2</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/11/25/convert-configmgr-error-codes-to-plain-text-messages-for-reporting-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 18:56:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/11/25/convert-configmgr-error-codes-to-plain-text-messages-for-reporting-part-2/</guid><description>I demoed this at MMS Jazz 2019 Tip and Tricks.
