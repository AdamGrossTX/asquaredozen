One of the devices kept ending up with a broken domain trust relationship when you attempt to log in immediately following build completion.
The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship One clue that we had was that something was renaming the device.</description></item><item><title>Gather No More – Using Dynamic Task Sequence Variables in ConfigMgr</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/02/20/gather-no-more-using-dynamic-task-sequence-variables-in-configmgr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 02:15:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/02/20/gather-no-more-using-dynamic-task-sequence-variables-in-configmgr/</guid><description>Update 09/14/2020 - You can download the Gather Light Task Sequence from the Community Hub now! https://communityhub.microsoft.com/item/7812
Update 02/21/2020 - I added a new section with a Gather Task Sequence. Check out the DIY Gather in the Task Sequence section below. It even has a GIF (unlike Software Center!)
If you&amp;rsquo;ve used the Microsoft Deployment ToolKit (MDT) or ConfigMgr or have ever heard of &amp;lsquo;Johan and Mikael&amp;rsquo;, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely used or at least heard/read about using MDT and the Gather script that&amp;rsquo;s included with it as part of your Task Sequences.</description></item><item><title>Debugging SCCM/ConfigMgr Task Sequences on the Fly</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/03/debugging-sccm-configmgr-task-sequences-on-the-fly/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 16:11:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/03/debugging-sccm-configmgr-task-sequences-on-the-fly/</guid><description>If you have worked with SCCM/ConfigMgr Task Sequences for any length of time, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely needed to debug them. Many times, you need to check the value of a Task Sequence variable. The generally accepted approach is to add a Run Command Line step to your Task Sequence and run ServiceUI.exe like this:
ServiceUI.exe -process:TSProgressUI.exe cmd.exe
This approach is great if you planned ahead and you are in a test Task Sequence.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 5 – Dynamic Whitelisting using the Cisco ISE External RESTful Service</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 07:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</guid><description>This is Part 5 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series. Be sure to check out all of the other parts.
A few months ago, when I published the first 4 parts on this series, I was unaware that there was a web service available for managing Cisco ISE, which is the NAC that I have to work with in my environment. I was fortunate to meet with a peer who works nearby and he shared a script demonstrating how to interact with the Cisco ISE External RESTful Service (ERS) to dynamically whitelist devices when WinPE starts for Bare Metal OSD and inside an SCCM/ConfigMgr Task Sequence for In-Place upgrades.</description></item><item><title>Clearing Local Group Policies during an Windows 7 to 10 In-Place Upgrade Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/16/clearing-local-group-policies-during-an-windows-7-to-10-in-place-upgrade-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/16/clearing-local-group-policies-during-an-windows-7-to-10-in-place-upgrade-task-sequence/</guid><description>Our Windows 7 Reference Image was originally built in 2011. At the time, we had some consultants in helping us migrate from Windows XP to Windows 7. At the time, the consultant who was building the image edited the Local Group Polices on the Windows 7 machine prior to capturing it. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve continued to service the WIM and use it as our production image. Some years later, we were trying to change our Windows Update settings and found these nice Local Group Policies just sitting there screwing everything up!</description></item><item><title>Dynamically Updating Unattend.XML during an OSD Task Sequence using MDT Variables and ZTI Scripts.</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/11/dynamically-updating-unattend-xml-during-an-osd-task-sequence-using-mdt-variables-and-zti-scripts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 21:25:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/07/11/dynamically-updating-unattend-xml-during-an-osd-task-sequence-using-mdt-variables-and-zti-scripts/</guid><description>While trying to set the KeyboardLocale in my ConfigMgr/SCCM Task Sequence, I found that my settings weren&amp;rsquo;t getting updated during the Task Sequence. I used to think that custom Unattend.XML that you include in your Task Sequence would be used as-is. I was wrong. I did a bit of digging and here&amp;rsquo;s what I discovered.
FYI: I&amp;rsquo;m using ConfigMgr/SCCM with MDT integrated and I&amp;rsquo;m using an MDT Task Sequence built in ConfigMgr as the basis for this discussion.</description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 06:26:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/hello-world/</guid><description>I guess that&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to start out.

Welcome back! As you can see, I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert, but I have been doing this for a while and just wanted to have a place to call my own where I can post with more than characters on Twitter. I hope that I will be able to add value to the community.</description></item></channel></rss>
