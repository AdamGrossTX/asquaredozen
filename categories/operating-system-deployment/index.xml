Setupconfig.ini Setupconfig.ini is a file that can be used to pass command line arguments to the Windows Setup engine during a Windows installation. When Setupconfig.ini is specified in the command line (/ConfigFile &amp;lt;path to Setupconfig.ini&amp;gt;) or exists in the default location (%systemdrive%\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WSUS\Setupconfig.ini), any arguments in it will take precedence over arguments specified in the commandline. If you use this file, ensure that you aren&amp;rsquo;t counteracting commandline args that you may be using with other deployment methods such as Task Sequences (Task Sequences simply generate a command line based on which options you select).</description></item><item><title>Building a Smarter Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/04/30/building-a-smarter-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 06:41:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/04/30/building-a-smarter-task-sequence/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m procrastinating prepping my sessions for MMS 2019 and decided I should write a blog post instead to help get me motivated.

Many times, you need to check the value of a Task Sequence variable. The generally accepted approach is to add a Run Command Line step to your Task Sequence and run ServiceUI.exe like this:
ServiceUI.exe -process:TSProgressUI.exe cmd.exe
This approach is great if you planned ahead and you are in a test Task Sequence.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 5 – Dynamic Whitelisting using the Cisco ISE External RESTful Service</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 07:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</guid><description>This is Part 5 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

After some helpful responses on Twitter, I was able to add a client action trigger step to the end of my Task Sequence. In my production environment, we have a child task sequence that we call that has several client action steps in it including Request Machine Assignments (Machine Policies) {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021}, Hardware Inventory {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001} and now a Discovery Inventory {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003}.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 1709 In-Place Upgrade Hangs on Making sure you're ready to install</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/05/21/windows-10-1709-in-place-upgrade-hangs-on-making-sure-youre-ready-to-install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 19:34:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/05/21/windows-10-1709-in-place-upgrade-hangs-on-making-sure-youre-ready-to-install/</guid><description>UPDATE #3 - 6/28/2018 Feel free to read below, however, if you want the quick solution, check out Marc&amp;rsquo;s updated blog post.

UPDATE #2 - 5/24/2018 After posting this, I came across these https://twitter.com/jarwidmark/status/998591545392685057 and http://blog.ctglobalservices.com/configuration-manager-sccm/mag/devicemap-and-device-inventory-failures-in-win7-to-win10-1709-in-place-upgrades/ which indicated that the fix was to update the devinv.dll file in Sources directory of your Windows 10 Upgrade media. This led me to finding out that KB2952664 updates devinv.</description></item><item><title>Task Sequence Failure "The software could not be found on any servers at this time" Caused by Retired Superseded Applications</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/04/18/task-sequence-failure-the-software-could-not-be-found-on-any-servers-at-this-time-caused-by-retired-superseded-applications/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 21:41:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/04/18/task-sequence-failure-the-software-could-not-be-found-on-any-servers-at-this-time-caused-by-retired-superseded-applications/</guid><description>Today was supposed to be easy. Things were just supposed to work. We had been testing our ConfigMgr Task Sequence for a few weeks and today was cutover day. We had made some backend changes to our Windows 7 Task Sequence to help get ready for our upcoming Windows 10 migration (I know, haven&amp;rsquo;t upgraded yet! Get off my case!). Earlier in the week, we found one last item that needed to be added.</description></item><item><title>WinPE Image fails to load on HP Proliant Gen9 servers using ADK 1709</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/27/winpe-image-fails-load-hp-proliant-gen9-servers-using-adk-1709/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 02:15:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/27/winpe-image-fails-load-hp-proliant-gen9-servers-using-adk-1709/</guid><description>We have several generations of HP ProLiant servers in our environment. We recently upgraded SCCM to 1710 then applied ADK 1709. We have been imaging these servers using the ADK 1703 Boot Image without issue. After upgrading to ADK 1709 and creating new boot images, we are unable to boot to into WinPE on any of our Gen9 servers. After doing the standard diagnostics (testing old, testing new, updating drivers, updating firmware, etc) we found that these servers would still freeze after downloading the boot WIM and get stuck on this screen:</description></item><item><title>Modern Driver Management and How I Barely Got It Working – Some Lessons Learned</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 03:57:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</guid><description>Several months ago, my boss came back from Microsoft Ignite where he &amp;lsquo;drank the Kool-Aid&amp;rsquo; big time. We had been telling him about all of the amazing things that were being released to help with the move to Modern Windows Management with Windows 10 for months but he got to hear it directly from some of the experts and got really excited. One of the things he suggested looking into came from a session with Mike Nystrom and Johan Arwidmark called Expert-level Windows 10 deployment (Skip to 50:12 for driver management).</description></item><item><title>Windows 7 to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) In-Place Upgrade Fails with error 0xC1900204 (Invalid Sku)</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:07:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</guid><description>We have built an SCCM In-Place upgrade task sequence to migrate our enterprise from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise.
