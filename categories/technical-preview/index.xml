This release introduced the first iteration of a feature that will hopefully help make Windows 10 Feature Update servicing a little easier to manage. Listed as Analyze SetupDiag errors for feature updates this feature has been added to the Windows 10 Servicing dashboard. When I initially read the release notes and looked at the included graph, I was disappointed.</description></item><item><title>ConfigMgr 1906 Technical Preview – Testing CMPivot over CMG using AdminService</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/06/18/configmgr-1906-technical-preview-testing-cmpivot-over-cmg-using-adminservice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 02:50:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/06/18/configmgr-1906-technical-preview-testing-cmpivot-over-cmg-using-adminservice/</guid><description>ConfigMgr 1906 Technical Preview was released last week and I immediately upgraded one of my tech preview labs I have running in Hyper-V on my laptop. As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the new AdminService functionality which will allow you to interact with the SMS Provider over HTTPS. With each release, it has had more features added. With Tech preview 1906, I noticed that you can run CMPivot using the AdminService.</description></item><item><title>The Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager Administration Service Guide</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/02/12/the-system-center-configuration-manager-adminservice-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 07:45:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/02/12/the-system-center-configuration-manager-adminservice-guide/</guid><description>This post is dedicated to the System Center Configuration Manger (SCCM/ConfigMgr) Administration Service (AdminService for short). Please check back here for helpful links and to blog posts, documentation and examples for using the AdminService. Please note, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what the name was officially when I first started, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to keep posting new info about it, so sorry if it&amp;rsquo;s disjointed.
Update: 11/3/2109 - I am updating this post to show information for the the latest ConfigMgr Current Branch release.</description></item><item><title>The ConfigMgr OData Web Service – V2</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/14/the-configmgr-odata-web-service-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 03:41:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/14/the-configmgr-odata-web-service-v2/</guid><description>I went to Microsoft Ignite 2018 for the first time this year. During the week, I got to chat with lots of folks, including some of the SCCM/ConfigMgr product group. Mark Silvey was kind enough to chat with me about plans for the OData connector that was first introduced in ConfigMgr 1612 Technical Preview. When it was first released it was called CMRestProvider and it had to be enabled in the console (you can read more about this initial implementation here).</description></item></channel></rss>
