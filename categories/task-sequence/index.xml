One of the devices kept ending up with a broken domain trust relationship when you attempt to log in immediately following build completion.
The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship One clue that we had was that something was renaming the device.</description></item><item><title>LockDown Diary – How I used DJOIN to Build Test Machines over VPN</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/05/05/lockdown-diary-how-i-used-djoin-to-build-test-machines-over-vpn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 05:16:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/05/05/lockdown-diary-how-i-used-djoin-to-build-test-machines-over-vpn/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since I&amp;rsquo;ve sat down to put write something.

Custom Actions Beginning in Windows 10 1803, custom actions were introduced and represent what Suma SaganeGowda referred to as a &amp;lsquo;poor man&amp;rsquo;s implementation of Task Sequences&amp;rsquo; at Ignite 2018 in session BRK3027. Windows setup will check for the existence of these special folders and scripts and use them as part of the Feature Update process. They allow you to run scripts at various stages in the Feature Update process as well as specify reflected driver paths just as you can in Setupconfig.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 Feature Updates – Leveraging SetupDiag for Better Reporting</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/08/22/windows-10-feature-updates-leveraging-setupdiag-for-better-reporting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 05:57:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/08/22/windows-10-feature-updates-leveraging-setupdiag-for-better-reporting/</guid><description>This is the first post of my Windows 10 Feature Updates series, probably totally out of sequence, but I just need to start getting the pieces written and published.

What is SetupDiag If you have worked with Windows 10 Operating System Deployments for any amount of time, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely had failures and encountered cryptic messages that you needed to triage. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ve come across SetupDiag. For the uninitiated, SetupDiag is a fancy little tool from Microsoft that you can run against the Windows installation logs (Panther Logs) either directly on a client or against an offline copy of the Panther logs from another client.</description></item><item><title>Building a Smarter Task Sequence</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/04/30/building-a-smarter-task-sequence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 06:41:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/04/30/building-a-smarter-task-sequence/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m procrastinating prepping my sessions for MMS 2019 and decided I should write a blog post instead to help get me motivated.

Many times, you need to check the value of a Task Sequence variable. The generally accepted approach is to add a Run Command Line step to your Task Sequence and run ServiceUI.exe like this:
ServiceUI.exe -process:TSProgressUI.exe cmd.exe
This approach is great if you planned ahead and you are in a test Task Sequence.</description></item><item><title>Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment – Part 5 – Dynamic Whitelisting using the Cisco ISE External RESTful Service</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 07:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/09/29/configuring-802-1x-authentication-for-windows-deployment-part-5-dynamic-whitelisting-using-the-cisco-ise-external-restful-service/</guid><description>This is Part 5 in my Configuring 802.1x Authentication for Windows Deployment series.

UPDATE #2 - 5/24/2018 After posting this, I came across these https://twitter.com/jarwidmark/status/998591545392685057 and http://blog.ctglobalservices.com/configuration-manager-sccm/mag/devicemap-and-device-inventory-failures-in-win7-to-win10-1709-in-place-upgrades/ which indicated that the fix was to update the devinv.dll file in Sources directory of your Windows 10 Upgrade media.
