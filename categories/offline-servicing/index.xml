One of the devices kept ending up with a broken domain trust relationship when you attempt to log in immediately following build completion.
The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship One clue that we had was that something was renaming the device.</description></item><item><title>Remove Windows 10 In-Box Apps with ConfigMgr or Intune and the Microsoft Store for Business</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/08/06/remove-windows-10-in-box-apps-with-configmgr-or-intune-and-the-microsoft-store-for-business/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:31:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2020/08/06/remove-windows-10-in-box-apps-with-configmgr-or-intune-and-the-microsoft-store-for-business/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been managing Windows 10 for very long, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely implemented a script or other method to remove some of the In-Box apps that come with Windows 10. We have been using a customized version of a script that Michael Niehaus published in 2015. It uses PowerShell and an XML file with a list of apps to be removed. I have integrated it into my Windows 10 offline servicing script that I use to apply updates to my image each month.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 Feature Updates â€“ Using Setupconfig.ini to Manage Feature Updates in the Enterprise</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/08/25/windows-10-feature-updates-using-setupconfig-ini-to-manage-feature-updates-in-the-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2019 00:24:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/08/25/windows-10-feature-updates-using-setupconfig-ini-to-manage-feature-updates-in-the-enterprise/</guid><description>This is the next installment in my Windows 10 Feature Updates series.
Setupconfig.ini Setupconfig.ini is a file that can be used to pass command line arguments to the Windows Setup engine during a Windows installation. When Setupconfig.ini is specified in the command line (/ConfigFile &amp;lt;path to Setupconfig.ini&amp;gt;) or exists in the default location (%systemdrive%\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WSUS\Setupconfig.ini), any arguments in it will take precedence over arguments specified in the commandline. If you use this file, ensure that you aren&amp;rsquo;t counteracting commandline args that you may be using with other deployment methods such as Task Sequences (Task Sequences simply generate a command line based on which options you select).</description></item><item><title>Adding Dynamic Updates to Windows 10 In-Place Upgrade Media During Offline Servicing</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/08/20/adding-dynamic-updates-to-windows-10-in-place-upgrade-media-during-offline-servicing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2018 06:14:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/08/20/adding-dynamic-updates-to-windows-10-in-place-upgrade-media-during-offline-servicing/</guid><description>For the past few months, there has been a community-wide push to determine the optimal approach for Offline Servicing Windows 10 media and to get Microsoft to take on more of this burden so we can get on with other tasks instead of dealing with servicing every month. Ultimately, Microsoft needs a better process for updating media each month, but until they do, all we can do is what we do best, Socially Engineer solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
