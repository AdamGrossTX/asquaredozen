During that process, I found that several of my clients had successfully been upgraded, but were still reporting the old OS version in the ConfigMgr console. My search led to several root causes which I&amp;rsquo;m still working through, but the solution in most cases was to force a Full Hardware Inventory on the client or fully uninstall, clean and reinstall the client - I also won&amp;rsquo;t go into those steps here.</description></item><item><title>Debugging “Failed to compile rule” client errors after SCCM Application Catalog Role Removal</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/07/10/debugging-failed-to-compile-rule-client-errors-after-sccm-application-catalog-role-removal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:06:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/07/10/debugging-failed-to-compile-rule-client-errors-after-sccm-application-catalog-role-removal/</guid><description>In my post Removing the Application Catalog Role after Upgrading to ConfigMgr 1806 I mentioned the error Failed to compile rule &amp;quot;{Rule_WRC10000}&amp;quot;: 0x8000ffff and that we were unsure of it&amp;rsquo;s impact on the client. The product group assured us that the error was nothing to worry about and they were right - I have seen no ill effects on my clients, even though I continually see this error whenever the clients process machine policies.</description></item><item><title>ConfigMgr 1906 Technical Preview – Testing CMPivot over CMG using AdminService</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/06/18/configmgr-1906-technical-preview-testing-cmpivot-over-cmg-using-adminservice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 02:50:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2019/06/18/configmgr-1906-technical-preview-testing-cmpivot-over-cmg-using-adminservice/</guid><description>ConfigMgr 1906 Technical Preview was released last week and I immediately upgraded one of my tech preview labs I have running in Hyper-V on my laptop. As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the new AdminService functionality which will allow you to interact with the SMS Provider over HTTPS. With each release, it has had more features added. With Tech preview 1906, I noticed that you can run CMPivot using the AdminService.</description></item><item><title>Dessert in the Desert – Highlights of My First MMS Conference (MMSDE)</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/12/07/dessert-in-the-desert-highlights-of-my-first-mms-conference-mmsde/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 03:54:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/12/07/dessert-in-the-desert-highlights-of-my-first-mms-conference-mmsde/</guid><description>At MMS Desert Edition (MMSDE) this week, I got into a (friendly) heated debate over what qualified as BBQ where the other party offered up some very silly arguments related to pulled pork and vinegar sauce. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in meat. Period. Cook it however you want, call it whatever you want. I just want to eat it. This discussion led to some additional &amp;lsquo;South Bashing&amp;rsquo; by this &amp;lsquo;Yankee&amp;rsquo; from North Carolina.</description></item><item><title>The ConfigMgr OData Web Service – V2</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/14/the-configmgr-odata-web-service-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 03:41:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/10/14/the-configmgr-odata-web-service-v2/</guid><description>I went to Microsoft Ignite 2018 for the first time this year. During the week, I got to chat with lots of folks, including some of the SCCM/ConfigMgr product group. Mark Silvey was kind enough to chat with me about plans for the OData connector that was first introduced in ConfigMgr 1612 Technical Preview. When it was first released it was called CMRestProvider and it had to be enabled in the console (you can read more about this initial implementation here).</description></item><item><title>Modern Driver Management and How I Barely Got It Working – Some Lessons Learned</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 03:57:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/modern-driver-management-barely-got-working-lessons-learned/</guid><description>Several months ago, my boss came back from Microsoft Ignite where he &amp;lsquo;drank the Kool-Aid&amp;rsquo; big time. We had been telling him about all of the amazing things that were being released to help with the move to Modern Windows Management with Windows 10 for months but he got to hear it directly from some of the experts and got really excited. One of the things he suggested looking into came from a session with Mike Nystrom and Johan Arwidmark called Expert-level Windows 10 deployment (Skip to 50:12 for driver management).</description></item><item><title>Windows 7 to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709) In-Place Upgrade Fails with error 0xC1900204 (Invalid Sku)</title><link>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:07:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.asquaredozen.com/2018/01/16/windows-7-windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-place-upgrade-fails-error-0xc1900204-invalid-sku/</guid><description>We have built an SCCM In-Place upgrade task sequence to migrate our enterprise from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise. We have been using the same basic TS for over a year without issues. With the release of Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (1709), we began having issues upgrading certain devices and were seeing error code 0xC1900204, indicating Invalid SKU.
Windows setup looks at the existing OS, install media and the command line image number to validate that the existing and desired versions are a match and can be upgraded.</description></item></channel></rss>
